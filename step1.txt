When running the 2 functions doublerAppend and doublerInsert, as the arrays get larger the time to run the function also gets bigger.
The first two arrays tinyArray and smallArray the . push method runs faster than the .unshift method. As the arrays get bigger 
the .unshift method has a shorter runtime than the .push method. So the scalability of the .push method would be better used for 
smaller type arrays. But once you start to get a lot of data that needs to be stored in arrays then the .shift method would be better useful.
